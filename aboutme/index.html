    <p>(Delchivo)</p>

    <p>My name is Arturo Mendoza, I am from Mexico City, I am 27 years old, I have a daughter and she is 2 years old,
        I've been married for 4 years, almost 5. I love music, videogames, food and my spend quality time with mi
        family.  I love technology and I am currently studying automotive engineering so, I am littl concern why I am
        taking this class, but it doesn't matter because is helping me so much and I like it so much. </p>
        <p>I love strategy games, family games such as scrabble, bananagrams, UNO, monopoly and more. I currenty
            work at Bestbuy as Geek Squad agent and this course is helping me to understan more about technology and
            websites.</p>
    <p>Some adventages that I see about learning web design is that I can use them to create my own website in the
        future and play more with it, and once I have my own company I can start with little prjects like this one.
        Something that I would like to add is that I love BYU because it is giving me tu study remotely and learn in
        different ways and I have time to work, studies, church and family.</p>
