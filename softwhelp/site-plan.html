      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[Have you ever had a virus on your computer or got hacked? or for some reason your computer gives you a blue or black screen with a sad face? Here is the place... I fix software issues on computers, I remove viruses, perform data transfers, run diagnostics to determine the issue, reestablish the operating systems and more. You may don't need to buy a new computer. I can give you the best advise according with the diagnostics results and I can recover information form broken devices (as far as the hard drive works). You don't know if your hard drive works? I can let you know.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
